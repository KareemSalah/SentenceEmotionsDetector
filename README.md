# SentenceEmotionsDetector
A simple website that can grasp the emotion of the user based on an input sentence or a group of sentences uploaded in a file. It can detect three emotions (Angry, Disgust, Joy) and shows the results on a chart (how many sentences are angry, disgust and so). It was built as a team course project for Natural Language Processing course at Cairo University.
